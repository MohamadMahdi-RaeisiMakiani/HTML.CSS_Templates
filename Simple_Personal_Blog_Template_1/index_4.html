						<p>Moon</p>
						<p>
							The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. At about
							one-quarter the diameter of Earth (comparable to the
							width of Australia),[16] it is the fifth largest
							satellite in the Solar System, the largest satellite
							in the Solar System relative to its major planet,[f]
							and larger than any known dwarf planet. The Moon is
							a planetary-mass object that formed a differentiated
							rocky body, making it a satellite planet under the
							geophysical definitions of the term.[17] It lacks
							any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic
							field. Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of
							Earth's (0.1654 g). Jupiter's moon Io is the only
							satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher
							surface gravity and density. Orbiting Earth at an
							average distance of 384,400 km (238,900 mi), or
							about 30 times Earth's diameter, its gravitational
							influence very slowly lengthens Earth's day and is
							the main driver of Earth's tides. The Moon's orbit
							around Earth has a sidereal period of 27.3 days.
							During each synodic period of 29.5 days, the amount
							of visible surface illuminated by the Sun varies
							from none up to 100%, resulting in lunar phases that
							form the basis for the months of a lunar calendar.
							The Moon is tidally locked to Earth, which means
							that the length of a full rotation of the Moon on
							its own axis causes its same side (the near side) to
							always face Earth, and the somewhat longer lunar day
							is the same as the synodic period. That said, 59% of
							the total lunar surface can be seen from Earth
							through shifts in perspective due to libration. The
							most widely accepted origin explanation posits that
							the Moon formed 4.51 billion years ago, not long
							after Earth, out of the debris from a giant impact
							between the planet and a hypothesized Mars-sized
							body called Theia. It then receded to a wider orbit
							because of tidal interaction with the Earth. The
							near side of the Moon is marked by dark volcanic
							maria ("seas"), which fill the spaces between bright
							ancient crustal highlands and prominent impact
							craters. Most of the large impact basins and mare
							surfaces were in place by the end of the Imbrian
							period, some three billion years ago. The lunar
							surface is relatively non-reflective, with a
							reflectance just slightly brighter than that of worn
							asphalt. However, because it has a large angular
							diameter, the full moon is the brightest celestial
							object in the night sky. The Moon's apparent size is
							nearly the same as that of the Sun, allowing it to
							cover the Sun almost completely during a total solar
							eclipse. Both the Moon's prominence in Earth's sky
							and its regular cycle of phases have provided
							cultural references and influences for human
							societies throughout history. Such influences can be
							found in language, calendar systems, art, and
							mythology. The first artificial object to reach the
							Moon was the Soviet Union's Luna 2 uncrewed
							spacecraft in 1959; this was followed by the first
							successful soft landing by Luna 9 in 1966. The only
							human lunar missions to date have been those of the
							United States' Apollo program, which landed twelve
							men on the surface between 1969 and 1972. These and
							later uncrewed missions returned lunar rocks that
							have been used to develop a detailed geological
							understanding of the Moon's origins, internal
							structure, and subsequent history.
						</p>
						<p>Mars</p>
						<p>
							Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the
							second-smallest planet in the Solar System, being
							larger than only Mercury. In English, Mars carries
							the name of the Roman god of war. Mars is a
							terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, and has a
							crust primarily composed of elements similar to
							Earth's crust, as well as a core made of iron and
							nickel. Mars has surface features such as impact
							craters, valleys, dunes, and polar ice caps. It also
							has two small and irregularly shaped moons, Phobos
							and Deimos. Some of the most notable surface
							features on Mars include Olympus Mons, the largest
							volcano and highest known mountain on any Solar
							System planet, and Valles Marineris, one of the
							largest canyons in the Solar System. The smooth
							Borealis basin in the Northern Hemisphere covers 40%
							of the planet and may be a giant impact feature.[19]
							The days and seasons on Mars are comparable to those
							of Earth as the planets have a similar rotation
							period and tilt of the rotational axis relative to
							the ecliptic plane. Liquid water on the surface of
							Mars cannot exist due to low atmospheric pressure,
							which is less than 1% of the atmospheric pressure on
							Earth.[20][21] Both of Mars's polar ice caps appear
							to be made largely of water.[22][23] Multiple lines
							of evidence suggest that Mars was wetter in the
							distant past, and thus possibly more suited for
							life. However, whether life ever did exist there,
							and if it could have survived to the present day,
							remain unanswered questions. Mars has been explored
							by several uncrewed spacecraft, beginning with
							Mariner 4 in 1965. NASA's Viking 1 lander
							transmitted the first images from the Martian
							surface in 1976. Two countries have successfully
							deployed rovers on Mars, the United States first
							doing so with Sojourner in 1997 and China with
							Zhurong in 2021.[24] There are also planned future
							missions to Mars, such as a Mars sample-return
							mission set to happen in 2026, and the Rosalind
							Franklin rover mission, which was intended to launch
							in 2018 but was delayed to 2024. Mars can easily be
							seen from Earth with the naked eye, as can its
							striking reddish coloring. This appearance, due the
							iron oxide prevalent on its surface, has led to Mars
							often being called the Red Planet.[25][26] It is
							among the brightest objects in Earth's sky, with an
							apparent magnitude that reaches âˆ’2.94, comparable to
							that of Jupiter and surpassed only by Venus, the
							Moon and the Sun.[14] Historically, Mars has been
							observed since ancient times, and over the
							millennia, has been featured in culture and the arts
							in ways that have reflected humanity's growing
							knowledge of it.
