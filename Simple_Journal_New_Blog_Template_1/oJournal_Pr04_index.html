										Measles is highly contagious and almost
										entirely preventable through
										vaccination. But the Covid pandemic led
										to a decline in vaccine coverage for the
										disease. There is now an imminent threat
										of measles spreading in various regions
										globally, as the Covid pandemic has led
										to a steady decline in vaccination
										coverage and weakened surveillance of
										the disease, the World Health
										Organization and the Centers for Disease
										Control and Prevention said Wednesday.
										Measles is one of the most contagious
										human viruses and is almost entirely
										preventable through vaccination.
										However, it requires 95% vaccine
										coverage to prevent outbreaks among
										populations. A record high of nearly 40
										million children missed a measles
										vaccine dose in 2021 due to hurdles
										created by the Covid pandemic, the WHO
										and the CDC said in a joint report.
										While measles cases have not yet gone up
										dramatically compared to previous years,
										now is the time to act, the WHO's
										measles lead, Dr. Patrick O'Connor, told
										Reuters. “We are at a crossroads,” he
										said Tuesday. “It is going to be a very
										challenging 12-24 months trying to
										mitigate this.” A combination of
										factors, such as lingering social
										distancing measures and the cyclical
										nature of measles, may explain why there
										has not yet been an explosion of cases
										despite the widening immunity gaps, but
										that could change quickly, O'Connor
										said, pointing out the highly contagious
										nature of the disease. The United
										Nations health agency has already seen
										an increase in large disruptive
										outbreaks since the start of the year,
										rising from 19 to almost 30 by
										September, he said, adding that he was
										particularly worried about parts of
										sub-Saharan Africa. Last week, the
										public health department in Columbus,
										Ohio, reported a measles outbreak with
										24 active cases, according to the NBC
										News affiliate WCMH. All of those cases
										are in unvaccinated children. A measles
										case often starts with a fever, but the
										illness is typically characterized by a
										rash that typically begins to spread
										from the face and neck after a few days.
										The virus can linger in the air and on
										surfaces for up to two hours, and an
										infected person can transmit the virus
										up to four days before and after the
										rash appears, according to the WHO.
										There is no specific antiviral to treat
										measles. The new report estimates that
										in 2021, around 128,000 people died of
										measles worldwide.

										BRASILIA, Brazil — A former student
										armed with a semiautomatic pistol and
										wearing a bulletproof vest fatally shot
										three people and wounded 13 on Friday
										after barging into two schools in
										southeastern Brazil, authorities said.
										The shootings took place at a public
										school with elementary and middle school
										students and a private school, both on
										the same street in the small town of
										Aracruz in Espirito Santo state, the
										state's public security secretariat said
										in a statement. Two teachers and a
										student were killed. Approximately four
										hours later, the shooter, identified as
										a 16-year-old boy who used to study at
										the public school, was arrested by
										police, Espirito Santo Gov. Renato
										Casagrande said. Authorities did not
										release the suspect's name. Security
										camera footage showed the assailant
										wearing a bulletproof vest and using a
										semiautomatic pistol for the attacks,
										Espirito Santo public security secretary
										Márcio Celante said in a video provided
										by the secretariat's press office.
										Casagrande said the weapon belongs to
										the former student's father, a military
										police officer. In addition to the
										fatalities, 13 people were wounded,
										including nine instructors, said
										Celante, who noted that in the public
										school the shooter gained access to the
										teachers lounge after breaking a lock.
										Six of the wounded, including two
										children, were still hospitalized Friday
										afternoon. School shootings are uncommon
										in Brazil, but have happened with
										somewhat greater frequency in recent
										years.

										It seems that when we speak of the
										personality recognition, or commenting
										on somebody's personality, we know very
										well what we are talking about. Also, if
										someone tells you that he/she is
										different in personality with his/her
										colleague, and therefore experience a
										lot of conflicts in the work
										environment, he/she is probably thinking
										that he/she has made their point very
										clear. The existence of significant
										demand for personality books and various
										classes and training courses on
										personality is another case that may
										cause us to think that personality are
										clearly defined for most people. But if
										you search a little and want to find out
										what “personality means” It was quickly
										concluded that there is no consensus on
										the definition of personality in the
										psychology, and about personality,
										everyone has raised their own opinion So
										you can't simply define personality. The
										most important thing to consider in the
										definition of personality is that the
										definition of behavior and personality
										have similarities and commons. But what
										distinguishes a personality from
										behavior is continuity, permanence, and
										survival of behavioral patterns: Once
										shouted, that is, you are angry
										(behavior); but repeatedly and under
										different conditions, it can mean that
										you are nervous and neurotic. Why is
										there no consensus on the personality?
										Personality studies the recognition of
										human personality, and a single
										definition of personality can be reached
										when the human definition of faith is
										clear and transparent. But scientists
										and researchers have different looks on
										the human. This variety of point of
										views is also reflected in the
										definition of personality. Personality
										deals with relatively fixed patterns in
										the characteristics, traits, and
										behaviors of each person; And it helps
										us to understand and predict his
										behaviors in different situations.
										Personality is what distinguishes a
										person from others and gives meaning to
										his Individuality. Individuality is the
										keyword of this definition. You can't
										find two people who have the same
										personality. Even if you consider a few
										specific components (e.g., Extraversion,
										honesty, emotional stability) and want
										to analyze all human beings on the basis
										of these elements, the way of combining
										these elements varies from person to
										person. If we take a little distance
										from scientific accuracy, we can compare
										each person's personality to a soup, the
										ingredients of which may be similar to
										another person's personality soup, but
										the share and composition of the
										ingredients cause a different taste to
										be formed. What is the root of the word
										Personality? The Personality is from the
										root “Persona”. The word was used in
										Latin for a mask that theater actors put
										on their faces to match their face with
										the role expected of them in the play.
										Of course, in the interpretation of
										etymologist experts, the term gradually
										becomes a concept that we use today.
										With this description, the term
										'personality' we apply is much closer to
										the concept of Personality in
										psychology. Since personality is the
										root of the characteristic, it points to
										the traits that distinguish each
										individual among the other people. Why
										don't we see the names of many of the
										great psychology elders in the list of
										those who have defined personality?
										Everywhere you looking for a definition
										of personality, most definitions are
										cited from the authors with the
										references and scattered papers This is
										because many of the elders who had talk
										about personality, they didn't directly
										address the definition of the word
										personality; but they have only analyzed
										the human personality. Then it was the
										academics who, by studying elders works,
										tried to figure out what the word
										personality meant in the writings and
										attitudes of each of these elders.
